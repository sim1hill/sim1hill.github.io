Chances are if you've learning Ruby One of the trickiest concepts to grasp in learning Ruby, and many other programming languages is the concept of object orientation. And just like the Kardashians somehow make i onto every reality tv show/magazine cover/tweet/department store objects really do permeate everything in the Ruby language. If like me you started your journey to learn Ruby printing out "Hello World" to your console a million times in awe then you're already working with one of the most abstract ideas in the language.

So where do the Kardashian/Jenner/Disick/West's fit into all of this? What makes learning object orientation so difficult is how abstract it is. And sometimes, no matter how many dog/owner and song/artist/genre analogies you work with it's not always super clear what goes where and when and why. When you're working on a basic level it's pretty easy to pick up on formulaic patterns to create something that can store and output information about itself. But one simple class all by it's lonesome isn't all that powerful. Sure, you could start stuffing that one class full of things, requiring more and more arguments be passed in but soon enough it becomes bloated and unwieldly. In fact, it's pretty boring.
