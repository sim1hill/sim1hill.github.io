  <h2>Mixed-Reality, Photo Recognition and the Future of Shopping</h2>
  <h4>by: Simone Hill</h4>

  <p>Shopping for new furniture is never an easy task, but the limited square footage of a New York City apartment make the experience less than ideal. After shopping on and saving products from Wayfair’s site for years I finally decided to download their app to more easily plan the decor for my new apartment while on the go. What I found was a helpful tool filled with features I didn’t never knew I needed, but now can’t shop for furniture without. Previously, furniture shopping was at best a mundane activity and at worst frustrating. Wayfair’s app goes a long way in improving that experience while also adding a layer of interactivity that makes me as a user want to shop because I want to, not because I have to. The innovation of the Wayfair app is how it leverages augmented reality (AR) and image recognition in a way that enhances the furniture shopping experience without feeling forced or gimmicky.</p>

<h3>View In Room</h3>

<p>Each item in Wayfair’s mobile catalogue features a button which opens the phone’s camera and overlays an image of the product. Pinching the screen allows the user to reposition and resize the item so it fits into the intended space giving the viewer a realistic idea of how the piece of furniture or decor will look in their home. The user can take a picture just as they would in the iPhone’s native camera, allowing them to save and review multiple options. Future enhancements could be integration of product recommendations into the virtual visual space, an option to view multiple products at once, auto-resizing of products and placement suggestions, to name a few. </p>

<h3>Photo-Based Search</h3>

<p>A camera icon at the top of the Wayfair app landing screen opens to another familiar camera UI. Snapping a photo of a piece of furniture, art or decor instantly loads a carousel of products aesthetically similar to the one in the photo including pricing. Selecting an item takes the user to a product page where the View In Room button is prominently displayed. For an interior design enthusiast this feature is a game changer. With the Wayfair app in hand a chic boutique hotel lobby or friend’s home can be a source of (discreet) design inspiration.</p>

<p>While these features that I love aren’t for everyone what I appreciate most about the app is that they’re there and easy to find if you do want them. However, if AR and photo search aren’t useful to a particular user they’re unobtrusive and don’t take away from the familiar mobile app shopping experience offered by the rest of the Wayfair app. Wayfair’s has a broad consumer demographic. A challenge in building a furniture shopping app for a brand like Wayfair is creating an experience that is intuitive, but also exciting for  the mobile-native onlne shopper, as well as the traditional online browser. Wayfair has created a process that seamlessly integrates AR and photo-based search into the shopping process. It’s clear that Wayfair has taken a thoughtful approach to integrating new technology and is considering more ways in which the shopping experience can look more realistic to users. In <a href="https://tech.wayfair.com/2018/08/the-first-ever-mixed-reality-commerce-experience/" target="blank"> mid-2018 </a> Wayfair announced a partnership with Magic Leap, which will bring enhanced spatial positioning. </p>

<p>Internal users benefit from the ‘View In Room’ and Photo-Based Search features as well. With each photo a user snaps, Wayfair gather’s data about the way people are designing and decorating their homes. In turn, this data can be leveraged to further improve the recommendations and positioning tools that help users make purchasing decisions.</p>
