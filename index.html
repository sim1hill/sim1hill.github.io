      <h1>Put a Method On It!</h1>


      <p>I like writing because it's the act of immediately taking something out of your head and putting it down on a page. But just like you can create complex meaning like metaphors and allusions out of words, I've found methods do something similar. Figuring out how methods could be called as a sort of proxy for their return is something that gave me a lot of trouble at first. While I do find that Ruby reads a lot like English in some ways, it's the implicit return values that aren't always what you think. 

      Just in case you're new to this whole Ruby thing (like I was up until just a few days ago). Ruby comes with some pre-built in methods for it's most important and useful built-in classes (more on this when I can better explain what those are!) including arrays, strings, integers, ranges to name a few. These built-in methods are powerful tools that can manipulate the data held within each of these very useful classes. Almost every reading I've done on methods describes them of the verbs of the coding world. So, easy, right?

      Wrong.
